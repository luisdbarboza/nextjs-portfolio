      `I wrote reusable components in angular, integrations with rest and graphql APIs, also used third party APIs like OpenAI, Airtable, credit card payments with a payment gateway called Azul, was in charge of building several sections of an ecommerce platform, and i also did some research on technologies like threejs, GLTF 3d specification, vector embeddings and RAG, among other things. 

Depending on the tasks, i also was in charge of creating and updating several API endpoints in a NestJS server.

Since the work i did was for a new startup with an everchanging set of prioritiies, our app changed a lot because we were always developing mvps, that's why i cannot provide visual references(screenshots) of the app we developed, but i can show proof of my work with my github profile, since i still have access to the organization and the repos i worked on, i may not have write privileges, but i can show you commits i made, and explain my contributions
